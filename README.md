# image inpainting detection readme file
 An official implementation code for my thesis "Image Inpainting Detection through Artificial Intelligence Techniques"
 
 # Depedency 
 - Python 3
 - Torch 1.81

 # Depedency 
To train or thes the network:
```
python main.py {train, test}
```

Then the network will detect the images in the ./Demo Dataset/demo input/inp_images/ and save the results in the ./Demo Dataset/demo output/pr_masks/ directory.
